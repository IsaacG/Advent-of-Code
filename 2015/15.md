* Initial iteration
  - Use `itertools.product(range(101), repeat=n - 1)`.
  - The n'th value is `100 - sum(values)`.
  - If the n'th value is less than 0, continue.
  - Getting 2.4s for part 1.
* Optimizations
  - The negative properties of each ingredient places an upper bound on each ingredient, possibly less than 100.
    + Use the `max(ingredient[property])` to compute the upper bound, such that `limit` of this plus `100 - limit` of other exceeds 0.
    + This can be used to generate a list of ranges for `itertools.product()`.
  - Attempt to write a custom `product()` which generates amounts which do not exceed 100.
    + This failed; the C/C++ implementation is fast while the Python version is not.
