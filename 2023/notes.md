# Day 01

## Issue One
I decided it would be good to use the faster desktop this year.
The exercise starts and I instantly realize my desktop doesn't have cookies set up to download the data.
Close that all down and switch to the server!

## Issue Two
Instead of adding `total += number[0] * 10 + number[-1]` I added `total += number[0] + number[-1]`.
Thankfully I fixed that pretty quickly to solve part 1.

## Issue Three

Those pesky overlapping values!
To handle the overlapping, it occurs to me that I can reverse the string and try scan-and-replace words with digits in both directions.
`eightwo` would become `8wo` when expanded from the left and `eigh2` when expanded from the right.
I store the line in a temp variable, expand from left, copy the temp and expand from the right.
Then I can add up the first from the left and last from the right.

```python
original = line
for word, digit ...: ... line = line.replace(word, digit)
line2 = line[::1]
for word, digit ...: ... line2 = line2.replace(word[::-1], digit)
total += first_digit(line) * 10 + first_digit(line2)
```

Alas, too many variables and too easy to confuse them. `line2 = line[::-1]` is using the mutated line and not `original`.
I only discovered this after abandoning ship and writing my new solution.

# Day 02

Not much to see here.

# Day 03

I used regex to find number start/ends then used `x in range(start, end + 1)` ... except the `re.match.span()` already adds +1 to the end so I was extending digits too far by one. That cost me at least 5 minutes.
