# Day 01

## Issue One
I decided it would be good to use the faster desktop this year.
The exercise starts and I instantly realize my desktop doesn't have cookies set up to download the data.
Close that all down and switch to the server!

## Issue Two
Instead of adding `total += number[0] * 10 + number[-1]` I added `total += number[0] + number[-1]`.
Thankfully I fixed that pretty quickly to solve part 1.

## Issue Three

Those pesky overlapping values!
To handle the overlapping, it occurs to me that I can reverse the string and try scan-and-replace words with digits in both directions.
`eightwo` would become `8wo` when expanded from the left and `eigh2` when expanded from the right.
I store the line in a temp variable, expand from left, copy the temp and expand from the right.
Then I can add up the first from the left and last from the right.

```python
original = line
for word, digit ...: ... line = line.replace(word, digit)
line2 = line[::1]
for word, digit ...: ... line2 = line2.replace(word[::-1], digit)
total += first_digit(line) * 10 + first_digit(line2)
```

Alas, too many variables and too easy to confuse them. `line2 = line[::-1]` is using the mutated line and not `original`.
I only discovered this after abandoning ship and writing my new solution.

Not much to see here.

## Approach

The parsing and mapping for this was a bit tricky.
I used a regex to find all the numbers on each line then used the `match.span()` to find the start and end position of each number.
This allowed me to find each coordinate with a digit and map those coordinates to the coordinate where each number starts.
Having a unique coordinate for each number makes it easy to identify unique adjacent numbers.

This produced three maps:
* start positions of numbers to the numeric values,
* digit coordinate to the number's start coordinate, and
* engine coordinate to symbol.

Using these three maps made the rest of the exercise relatively simple, once I corrected my off-by-one error.

## Issue One
I used regex to find number start and end position of each number, then used `x in range(start, end + 1)` to map each digit to the number's start coordinate.
However, the `re.match.span()` already adds +1 to the end so I was extending digits too far by one.
This managed to work with the example input but not my real input.
That cost me at least 5 minutes.

# Day 04

Relatively straight forward day.
Part two took a bit of squinting to understand what was being asked but the example helped.
