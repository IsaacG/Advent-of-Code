# FlipFlop Codes

A fun little challenge.

2025 contains seven (7) puzzles, each three (3) parts.
The parts all lean on each other nicely.

This challenge was written by a university student for their classmates.
It's on the easier side, a bit easier than Codyssi.
It's well put together and quite fun.
